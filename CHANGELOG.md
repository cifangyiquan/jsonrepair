## 2021-06-09, version 2.2.1

## 2021-01-13, version 2.0.0

- Renamed the library from `simple-json-repair` to `jsonrepair`.
  Thanks a lot @vmx for making this npm package name available!
- Change source code from TypeScript to JavaScript. Reasons: TypeScript 
  conflicts with using native ESM, requiring ugly workarounds. 
  Due to some (old) TypeScript issues we also have to use `@ts-ignore` a lot. 
  Using TypeScript makes running tests slower. And in this case, TypeScript 
  hardly adds value since we have a very simple API and function signatures.

- Implement support for adding missing end brackets for objects and arrays.
